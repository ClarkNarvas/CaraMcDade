Hi, I’m Cara McDade and I’m running to be the U19’s officer as I believe in making Scottish Labour more enjoyable and accessible for young people. Now more than ever our voices need to be heard. The pandemic is tough on everyone but young people have barely been listened to. Our mental health has never been adequately supported, and it’s got even worse due to lockdowns and the uncertainty of exam results. We need to have our say on the things that matter to us. 

I want to make SYL a welcoming and safe environment for all. I will work hard to make it a place where everyone can express their views and be listened to. As a Young Labour member, I know how nerve wracking it can be to get involved in the party and express your views freely. As a party, we have to focus on the future that means no more in-fighting. I’m not tied to any fraction of the party, so I will listen to all views and try my best to represent them. I will press the leadership on issues that matter most to us, such as LGBTQ+ rights, mental health and green policies. 

In ways of making the party more enjoyable and accessible, that can be up to you. I’d like to hear any and all ideas on ways we can better support young members. Personally I’d like to see more young people involved at a local level, as I know a lot of us don’t attend CLP meetings as we feel nervous and alone. As U19’s officer my main priority will be making sure that all Young Scottish Labour members feel supported, listened to and ready to be more involved.
