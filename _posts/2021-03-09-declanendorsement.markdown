Declan McLean, the former Chair of the Strathclyde University Labour Club, has endorsed Cara McDade and the slate alongside her. Read his endorsement statement here. ðŸ‘‡
________

â€œThis is an exceptionally strong and capable group of young people who have the right mix of enthusiasm and talent to help rebuild and create a  proactive and engaged youth wing for Scottish Labour

I have worked and campaigned with each of them and know their passion and dedication for the party. Ross brings energy, valuable lived experience and bold thinking; Eoin offers fresh and modern graphic design capacity and Iona has a great ability to lead.

I know this entire group would strengthen SYLâ€™s links with Trade Unions, support young members and motivate voters behind Labourâ€™s policies."
