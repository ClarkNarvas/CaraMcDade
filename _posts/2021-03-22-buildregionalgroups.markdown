Cara McDade has delivered one of her primary campaign pledges: Helping build and backing Scottish Young Labour groups across the country. Out of the eight regions in Scotland, three are filling up forms to set up. 

She hasn't just backed them though, she has taken this policy personally and has founded a regional group in Glasgow. 

These groups will build SYL's presence to become a prominent and relevant campaign-force for socialism in Scotland. 

Here is a list of regions that are setting up ðŸ‘‡

Central Scotland - Aaron McLachlann

Glasgow - Cara McDade

Lothian - Emily G

To help complete this policy, we need you to help us build these groups. Gaining or winning in, not just May, but in future elections requires all of us to roll up our sleeves and build the movement we want.

Organise and build a regional group today ðŸ‘‡
